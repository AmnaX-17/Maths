# Graphing a Quadratic Function

## Question

Graph the quadratic function:

\[
h(x) = -4(x - 3)(x - 1)
\]

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Find the x-intercepts
Set \(h(x) = 0\) (points where the graph touches the x-axis):

\[
-4(x-3)(x-1) = 0
\]

Solve each factor:

\[
x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3
\]
\[
x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1
\]

✅ *x-axis points:* \((1,0)\) and \((3,0)\)

---

### Step 2: Find the vertex (x-coordinate)
The vertex lies midway between the x-intercepts:

\[
x = \frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2
\]

---

### Step 3: Find the y-coordinate of the vertex
Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation:

\[
h(2) = -4(2-3)(2-1)
\]
\[
h(2) = -4(-1)(1)
\]
\[
h(2) = 4
\]

✅ *Vertex:* \((2,4)\)

---

### Step 4: Determine the direction of the parabola
The coefficient of the squared term is negative (\(-4\)), so the parabola opens *downward (∩)*.

---

## Final Answer

- *x-intercepts:* \((1,0)\) and \((3,0)\)  
- *Vertex:* \((2,4)\)  
- *Direction:* Downward
